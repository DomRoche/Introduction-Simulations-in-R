# Number of simulations `nrep`

Sampling theory applies to the number of simulations `nrep` just as much as the sample size `n` within a simulation.

Now, let's do the same with a number of repeats `nrep` of 1000.

### Conclusion  
The number of simulations needs to be a big enough number to obtain a good representation of the distribution of the simulation results, e.g. 1000.
